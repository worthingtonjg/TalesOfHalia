# TalesOfHalia

My 12 year old daughter and I made this 2D Platformer at the 2024 Utah Indie Game Jam.

- All the artwork we got for free on the Unity Asset Store
- She wired up all the animation and animation controllers
- She helped make all the prefabs
- She designed all the levels
- I wrote all the code and taught her how to do everything
